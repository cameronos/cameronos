Hello, thanks for visiting. My name is **cameron** (stylized all lowercase), but you might also know me as **cameronos**, **vulture001** or **camekommd**.<br>
I do alot of things on a daily basis, but with software, I'm a **self-taught full stack software engineer** working on various projects.<br>
Majority of my contributions are private, but I will still try to focus on committing myself to **open-source** projects and libraries!

### Contact

You can get in touch with me either via Discord (cameron#9361) or [email](mailto:camekommd@gmail.com).<br>

### My goals

Every software engineer oftenly wants to advance their skill set, as do I. Learning new programming languages and strengthening the knowledge of ones I already know is a goal of mine I actively pursue. If my programming skills help people, then I will be happy.

### What I do outside of software

Many things... maybe too many....

Software engineering, for the record, is **NOT** my main profession. Outside of it, I am a full-time analog audio-engineer, and plan to take classes for it. I use reel-to-reel tape, cassette tape, and records frequently, and listen to all kinds of music. It fufills me much more than code does, and it is what I spend majority of my time on.

Here is a small list of everything else I do:

- Herald (Marshal of Arms of the Society of Arms, Gadus King of Arms of Baustralia, and Principal Heraldic Advisor in Kapreburg)
- Micronational lawyer and judge (Chief Justice of Paloma, Minister of Justice in Yu-Xia)
- Graphic designer (logos, brands)
- Analog audio engineering (reels, cassettes, records)

#### Thanks!

Thank you for reading my long dointing monologue about my coding habits. (and other things for that matter)<br>Feel free to dig around my repos.<br>
