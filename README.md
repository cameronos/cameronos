Hello, thanks for visiting. My name is **cameron** (stylized all lowercase), but you might also know me as **cameronos**, **vulture001** or **camekommd**.<br>
I do alot of things on a daily basis, but with software, I'm a **self-taught full stack software engineer** working on various projects.<br>
Majority of my contributions are private, but I will still try to focus on committing myself to **open-source** projects and libraries where I can.

### My goals

Iâ€™m focused on learning new programming languages and deepening my knowledge of the ones I already know. 
Currently, Iâ€™m working on building my 32-bit operating system and actively developing mods for video games (mainly KTANE and Minecraft). 
If my programming skills can be useful in any way, Iâ€™ve achieved my goals!!!
